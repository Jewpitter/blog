# Aren't parades pretty fun?  

Maybe? Sometimes? Usually?  
To be honest, I think that parades are mostly for the people actually in the parade. The ideal parade would be one where everyone is in the parade, but it just wouldn't be the same without the crowds of people all around. The best solution I can think is that people start joining in the parade at the back, so they will have both the experience of being in the parade and also being the audience.

Perhaps I'm being too hard on the parade.  
Afterall, the last parade I took part in was a parade celebrating the first ever Blues victory in the Stanley Cup. The players walked down the streets of downtown St. Louis while fans shouted and congratulated the players. It was a very fun time, and the whole city seemed to be there in the streets.  
I was definitely not upset to be in that crowd.  

**I have a picture, so I'll add it here!**

Soon, I want to learn how to add video into a website so that I can post that here too!
