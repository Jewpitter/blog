This lab has been very frustrating to finish.  
The Lucid Chart was fun and intuitive. I thought about the relationships and how all the things are meant to interact with each other. I was able to graph these all out during my American Century history class. I was able to do this because our professor had to leave for the day or something, and never let us know. A lot of people just left after a few minutes, but I used the time to be productive.  
**Here it is!**

Once I started the Vertabelo, everything changed. It's not intuitive. It's actively hampering my ability to do the work. Everytime my finger accidentally brushes my little track pad, I zoom all the way out and then all the way back in. Then, I was unable to add any foreign keys. I investigated, searching online and asking my classmates. It was then I realized my Vertabelo looks different than others, and I still don't know why.  
**Here's the one I managed to put together**

I'm not very satisfied with this, and I'll have to restart my Vertabelo learning from scratch.
