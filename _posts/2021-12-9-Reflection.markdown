**SW Reflection**


*What skills and talents are most valuable in carrying out the social change work you are doing with your community partner?*  
*How well do those skills mesh with the talents or limitations you have come to see in yourself through the experience?*  

Our community partners are dedicated to reaching the most people possible, and getting them to vote on issues that they find important. In order to reach as many people as possible, the volunteers at Indivisible Arkansas need a system to keep track of contacting the voters they help to register. In terms of social change, the thing that we could provide was that system to help the volunteers at Indivisible Arkansas reach more Americans and convince them to vote. We used our skills at programming to create a database in line with the things we were learning in our Database and Web Systems course and in line with the needs of Indivisible Arkansas. Hopefully, after some improvements made by Disco Tray Studios, Indivisible Arkansas will actually use our project to communicate with all the people they keep in contact with regarding voting.  
In terms of how this plan meshed with reality, I was genuinely disappointed in what we were able to piece together to show to Indivisible Arkansas. I think that our website works (at least it works locally), but it is not intuitive or streamlined. Eventually, I had to convince myself that I am just a student and that Disco Tray Studios will be able to make it into a better finished product. I took the service to the world portion of this project very seriously, and I feel like we fell a bit short with serving Indivisible Arkansas a useful system to help them in their goals. If there was no more development going into the website, I don't think they would replace their current system with what we made them.  




*Consider the social, environmental, or spiritual need on which you are focusing for this Odyssey project.*  
*Do you feel that the approaches to creating social change employed by your community partner are effective ways of creating change in this area?*  
*Why or why not?*  

In terms of what I can do as a programmer for driving up voting and creating meaningful legislative change, I believe that this is a great use of time and energy. The best way to get people to vote is to explain the necessity of participating in the process despite the roadblocks that keep so many from voting. Democracy should function better as voting becomes more inclusive and all voices are heard, and getting the word out through organizations like Indivisible Arkansas is an effective way to reach people today.  
I do worry about repetitive emails going straight to the bin without being read, and I know I have signed up for various political communications and ignored the emails until I eventually opt out of receiving them. However, if my work has made it easier for volunteers to communicate and help other people stay informed and engaged enough to vote, I think that it was a worthwhile change. I suppose one of my great regrets (if that's what I want to call it) of this project is that I will not be able to know how successful it is compared to what they are doing now.  




*Have any of your fundamental values, social ideals, or significant beliefs been challenged or confirmed through this experience?*  
*Have you found any of your academic coursework helpful in understanding what you have observed and experienced?*  
*Anything you learned in class that you would directly challenge now that you have had this experience?*  

I don't think many of my fundamental ideals have been questioned through this project, but I have been given some insight into how dedicated the people are who work in organizations like Indivisible Arkansas. They took time out of their busy schedules to speak with us and describe the volunteers who they work with. Many are older people who strongly believe in their mission enough to suffer through trying to figure out working on a computer. I hope that Disco Tray Studios can pick up our project and make it even easier for these dedicated volunteers to do what they find meaningful and necessary.  
The coursework was not particularly related to the social project of Indivisible Arkansas, but I do think that Dr. Goadrich gave us a great opportunity to engage with Indivisible Arkansas and really understand their mission enough to apply our work to help them in their mission.  
I don't think I would change anything for this class in terms of the work assigned to us, but there was a layer of difficulty that emerged because everyone was working on such diverse projects.  




*There are many social, political, environmental, or community issues on which you might work in the years ahead.*  
*How has this experience reshaped your views on the public issues that call you to action?*  

This project gave me a new appreciation for the challenges that emerge from deceptively simple tasks, and I am slowly learning to manage my time and give myself more opportunities to work on smaller things that require more thought. This applies to school work, life's chores, and any other issues that I give my attention and effort towards solving.  
Public issues require the cooperation of different groups of people to solve in new and unforeseen ways. I would have never thought about the specific uses and issues that arise when volunteers engage with the mission of Indivisible Arkansas, and I was grateful that our clients were able to describe the issues to us as organizers and leaders within Indivisible Arkansas while also being flexible in how we might solve them as programmers. On a similar note, I was impressed with the different approaches my group members made with creating our collective project. Sometimes I struggled with creating something, like our "Script Generation" page, that another group member was able to figure out by switching the approach. It was also very beneficial to see another group's work and have it explained in a way that I could understand. Everyone was every receptive to my questions and wanted to help, and I hope that I showed my appreciation as much as I felt it.  
Things are never accomplished in a vacuum, and I hope that I can always find a supportive community every time I am called to action.
