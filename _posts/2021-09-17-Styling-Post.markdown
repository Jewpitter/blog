This lab has just blown by, and I'm surprised I'm finishing it just now. Today, I was able to finish just about all of my study abroad paperwork and I'm really looking forwards to things this weekend. I was also able to stop by Dr. Goadrich's office and he used his wizard powers to fix my stuff as he always seems to be able to do. I was not able to get my image to show up, so I will take a look at that later and try to fix it. That's one of my favorite things about what we're doing: I can always go back and fix things later.

I'm not sure why I picked parades, but I'm happy that it reminded me of the Blues parade I went to. That was a very fun time and I will remember the feeling of the whole city celebrating forever Although it felt massive, the [largest parade in the world, Schützenfest,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%BCtzenfest) blows our little St. Louis celebration out of the water, and for a weird event. I didn't realize that marksmanship was so popular in Germany... or maybe the event has grown into something greater from the origins and it's not really about marksmanship too much anymore. I do like the outfits.

This class seems to be falling into place, but I really feel like we're only just scratching the surface, and I'm not 100% what's even going on with just this lab. I don't know how markdown works, but I have *looked* **a few** ***things up*** and it seems like it will be

There are a lot of things going on with this lab and the previous one, and I've only been able to get through it by putting my head down and following the steps one at a time. I'm trying to be more comfortable with creating something without really understanding how everything works. The main issue with that is that it can be difficult to implement and bug fix. However, I'm trying to keep in mind the vast difference in quality between my first and last video games last semester, and trusting that the process will have a similar pattern in this class.
