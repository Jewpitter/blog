To be completely transparent, I really did not contribute to this lab. All credit should go to Campbell. By the time that we were ready to work on Lab 9, I had taken over the lead on working on our final project, and we reached an agreement to split the tasks between us. Even with that, our lab 9 is bare bones and we were never able to implement Azure on our final project.  

I'm actually not even sure if we successfully completed lab 9, or whether we accepted our losses and moved on to entirely focusing on the final project. I could try to go back and work through it, but the final project needs all hands on board or we will be unable to finish.  

I've heard many horror stories about people hitting a brick wall with this lab. I suppose I did too, in a way.
