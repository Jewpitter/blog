My name is Josh and I'm the coolest dog in the pound... at least that's what I said when I was little.

Here's a nifty little website that's helping me to learn about websites.
While it's not as immediately fun as the video game class I took last semester so far, it's been really cool to learn about how the internet really works, but the more I learn, it seems like the less I really know. I guess that's the paradox of learning, though. I think Socrates said something about that.

Anyways, I like to code and feel that satisfying feeling of things fitting nicely into place when everything is working. It also serves as a little voice in the back of my head that becomes a little louder when I tell people I'm a history major and they ask what I'm going to do with it. I can always say that I am a computer science minor and that's always in demand, so they tend to not follow up.

Why don't you click around a little bit and see what's going on?
